/**
 * The side panel for the issue named by `?issue=` in the URL (a readable key such as WEB-12, or an old id),
 * or nothing when there is none. A page renders this once and passes `panel.open` to its issue cards.
 * IssueByKey finds the issue and keys the detail by its id, so an edit form left open on one issue does not
 * carry over to the next one.
 *
 * When the issue is closed the panel slides out instead of vanishing: it stays mounted for the
 * exit animation (useExitPresence) and keeps showing the issue it had, while the URL has already
 * lost `?issue=`. Opening another issue while one is open keeps the same panel (no slide again).
