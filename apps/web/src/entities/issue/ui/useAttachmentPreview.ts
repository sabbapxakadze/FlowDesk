/**
 * State shared by everything that previews an attachment (the link, the comment
 * thumbnail): is the popup open, and which URL to request.
 *
 * The signed download link lives only 5 minutes and is minted when the attachment
 * list is fetched, so a page left open can hold an expired link. When a file fails to
 * load, `onLoadError` refetches the list once; the parent re-renders with the fresh
 * link and `attempt` is bumped so the file is requested again even when the refreshed
 * link happens to be identical (a refetch within the same second mints the same
 * signature; the server ignores query parameters it does not know). Opening the popup
 * allows one more refresh, so a thumbnail that already used its retry does not stop
 * the popup from recovering.
