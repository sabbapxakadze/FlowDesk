/**
 * Extends projectKeys.all rather than starting a fresh base array —
 * issues are nested under a project the same way the URL nests them,
 * so invalidating "all projects" data could reasonably cascade to issues
 * too. Same factory shape as entities/project/api/queryKeys.ts.
 *
 * list() takes an optional filters object — WITH filters, it's a distinct
 * cache entry per status/order combination (useIssues passes these so a
 * filtered view doesn't show another filter's cached pages). WITHOUT
 * filters, it returns the plain [..., projectId] key, which is a *prefix*
 * of every filtered variant's key — so existing
 * invalidateQueries({ queryKey: issueKeys.list(projectId) }) calls
 * (CreateIssueForm, EditIssueForm) keep invalidating every filtered
 * variant via TanStack's partial key matching, with no changes needed
 * there.
