/**
 * The two file stores behind lib/storage.ts (ADR 0053), run through ONE set of checks. Why one set: the app must not be able to tell the
 * disk from the object store, so anything the app relies on (a whole read, a byte range for video seeking, the size, a missing file) is
 * asserted on both. The s3 store talks to a fake S3 inside this process (lib/fake-s3.ts), so no network or account is needed.
