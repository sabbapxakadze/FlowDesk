/**
 * The CONTENT of the demo organization (ADR 0039): who is in it, the labels, and every project's issues, sprints and comments.
 * Plain data, no database calls; `seed-demo.ts` turns it into rows. Times are written as "days ago" (or "days from today" for
 * due dates), so the demo always looks current whenever it is (re)built.
 *
 * Comment text can mention a person with `{alex}`, `{nino}`... which becomes the real `@[Name](user:<id>)` token (ADR 0033).
