 *  2. Demos whose time is up are deleted first: cleanup happens when someone starts a new one, no scheduler needed yet.
 *  3. If DEMO_MAX_ACTIVE copies are alive, say so instead of making another. (A soft cap: requests arriving in the same instant can
 *     overshoot it by a few; the rate limit keeps that small.)
 *  4. Build the copy (it expires DEMO_TTL_MINUTES from now) and sign the visitor in as its owner, the way a login does.
