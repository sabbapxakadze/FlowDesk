# 0055 - Watching the live site: smoke check, uptime, backups, error tracking

Status: Accepted - 2026-10-09. Phase 9 slice 9.9. Builds on ADR 0049 (first deploy, no keep-alive pings), 0050 (secrets out of logs), 0053 (object storage) and 0054 (security pass).

## Context

The site is public and runs on free hosting that sleeps. Nobody would notice it going down, a database mistake could not be undone past Neon's short history window, and an unexpected server error was visible only to someone reading Render's log (the first failed file upload was found that way). The constraints from earlier decisions: no keep-alive pings, no card, no paid service, a public repository.

## Decisions

1. **A read-only smoke tool** (`apps/api/src/tools/smoke-live.ts`, run with `node apps/api/src/tools/smoke-live.ts <address>`). GET requests only: the health check, that the app's page is served, a strict Content-Security-Policy, `nosniff`, no `X-Powered-By`, HSTS, a private endpoint answering 401, an unknown API address answering a JSON 404, `/.env` and `/.git/config` not served as files, the sign-in providers and the demo info answering. It waits for a sleeping server to wake. It is self-contained (only Node's own modules), so Node 24 runs the file directly with no install. It does not touch the database, so a database outage alone is not detected. Tests break one thing at a time against a fake site and require the matching check to go red (a mutation that always passes a check was caught).
2. **A daily uptime check** (`.github/workflows/uptime.yml`): GitHub's own scheduler runs the smoke tool once a day. No third-party monitor, no account, and ONE request a day, so the server is still allowed to sleep (the earlier decision against keep-alive pings stands: a monitor that pings every few minutes would keep the free server running all month and use up its free hours). The cost is that an outage can go unnoticed for up to a day.
3. **A weekly encrypted backup** (`.github/workflows/backup.yml`, `docs/backups.md`): `pg_dump` of the live database, a check that the archive lists the users table, AES-256 encryption with a passphrase kept in a repository secret, kept as a workflow artifact for 90 days. Encrypted because the repository is public and the dump holds emails and password hashes. It covers the database only, not the bucket. Neon's own 6-hour history window is the first layer.
4. **Error tracking with Sentry, server side only, off unless `SENTRY_DSN` is set** (`lib/error-reporting.ts`). Unexpected errors (the generic 500s) and a crash are sent with the error, the request id, the method and the route pattern, and the running commit. Not sent: cookies, headers, bodies, the visitor's address, the signed-in person, breadcrumbs, traces; every automatic collection switch is off by name, and an email address inside an error message is replaced. Expected errors (404, 403, validation, a 503 for disabled uploads) are not reported, to keep the free quota (5,000 a month, as read from a third-party summary) for real bugs. The SDK is loaded only when the DSN is set: loading it measured about 31 MB of memory (53 to 84 MB) and starting it about 2 MB more, on a 512 MB server.

## Not done, and why

- **Error tracking in the browser.** It would need the page's security policy to allow the tracker's address and a build-time setting; the browser errors people hit are not visible yet. A later slice if wanted.
- **Alerting beyond what GitHub and Sentry do by themselves.** Whether GitHub emails the owner when a scheduled run fails was not verified.
- **Backup of the files in the bucket,** and a tested restore into a real database (the local role cannot create one).

## Not verified

The two workflows running on GitHub (neither can run until they are pushed and, for the backup, the secrets exist); Sentry receiving a real event (the tests use a fake transport, so nothing was sent to Sentry); GitHub disabling scheduled workflows after a long quiet period in a public repository (I believe it does after 60 days without repository activity; not verified); Sentry's free-plan limits (from third-party summaries).

## What needs the owner

`DATABASE_URL` and `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` as repository secrets and one manual run of the backup; a Sentry account (free) and its DSN as `SENTRY_DSN` in Render, if error tracking is wanted; passphrase kept in a password manager.
